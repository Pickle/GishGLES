To use these texturesets (NOT RECOMMENDED - SEE BELOW) copy any of these folders to ..\tile07
You can then load them with the texture loader and drag them into your level's textureset.

These texturesets are mainly here to satisfy licensing issues and to make it easier to show players what files are licensed under what license. Maybe -in the future- textures are linked rather than embedded in level files. :)

USING THESE TEXTURESETS MANUALLY IS NOT RECOMMENDED!!
These texturesets lack .blk (block definition) files. Thus, you'll have to manually recreate their properties if you import them the 'classic' way.
Please import the texturesets from the newest FreeGish map, instead!! :)
